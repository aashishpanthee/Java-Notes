**** JDBC ******
JDBC is a technology which can be used to communicate with database from java-applications.
- JDBC is a part of Java Standard Edition(JSE).
- JDBC is a specification(Guidelines) defined by java vendor and implemented by Database vendor.
- Database vendor provided implementation is called Driver Software.

**** JDBC Features *****
- JDBC is a standard API we can communicate with any database without rewriting our application. i.e. it is Database Independent API
- Most of JDBC Drivers are developed in Java and hence JDBC concept can work for any platform. i.e. it is platform independent technology
- By using JDBC API, we can perform basic CRUD operations very easily.
- Huge vendor support for JDBC. They developed multiple products based on JDBC API.

** Version of JDBC **
=> Current version of JDBC is JDBC 4.2v, which is a part of Java Standard Edition 8.


*********** Basic Components of JDBC Applications **********
1. Database Driver  => Translator 
=> To convert java apllication calls into database calls and database calls into java-application calls, we need translator which is called Driver.

2. Connection  => Road
=> Connection Object can be used to communicate with database from java-applications.

3. Statement  => Vehicle
=> To send SQL query from our java applications to database and to bring results from database to our java-applications , vehicle is required which is nothing but statement object.

4. ResultSet  => Box
=> ResultSet holds results of SQL query.  Java Applications can get results from ResultSet only.

 ******** Steps to develop JDBC Applications ***********
 1. Load and Register Driver
 2. Establish Connection between Java-Application and Database
 3. Creation of Statement Object.**** JDBC ******

 4. Send and execute SQL query.
 5. Process Result from ResultSet.
 6. Close Connection.


 ** Difference between ODBC and JDBC **
 
 1. JDBC 
 => JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity
 => Introduced by Sun Micro Systems in 1997
 => We can use JDBC only for Java Language
 => We can use JDBC for any platform
 => Mostly JDBC Drivers are developed in Java
 => For Java applications, it is highly recommended to use JDBC because there are no performance and platform dependent problems.

 2. ODBC
 => ODBC stands for Open Database Connectivity
 => Introduced by Microsoft in 1992
 => We can use ODBC for any language like C, C++, Java, etc.
 => We can use ODBC only for windows platform
 => Mostly ODBC Drivers are developed in native languages like C, C++
 => For Java applications, it is not recommended to use ODBC because performance will be down due to internal conversions and applications will become platform dependent.
