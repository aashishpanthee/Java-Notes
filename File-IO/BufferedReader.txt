- We can use BufferedReader to read character data from the file. 
- The main advantage of BufferedReader when compared with FileReader is we can read data line by line in addition to character by character.

*Constructors*
i. BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(Reader r);
ii. BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(Reader r, int bufferSize);

Note: BufferedReader can't communicate directly with the file  and it can communicate via some Reader object.

*Methods*
i. int read();
ii. int read(char[] ch);
iii. void close();
iv. String readLine(); => It attempts to read next line from the file and returns it. If the next line not available then this method returns null.

Example:
    FileReader fw = new FileReader(new File("File-IO", "abc.txt"));
    BufferedReader bw = new BufferedReader(fw);
    String line = bw.readLine();
    while (line != null) {
      System.out.println(line);
      line = bw.readLine();
    }
    bw.close();

Note: Whenever we are closing BufferedReader , automatically underlying FileReader will be closed and we are not required to close explicitly.
      The most enchanced reader to read character data from the file is BufferedReader.
