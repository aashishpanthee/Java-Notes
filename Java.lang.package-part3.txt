d. getClass()
=> We can use getClass() method to get runtime class definition of an object.
  public final Class getClass()
  By using this Class class object , we can access class level properties like fully qualified name of the class , methods information, constructors information etc.
  Example 1:
      import java.lang.reflect.*;
      class Program{
        public static void main(String[] args){
          Object obj = new String("aashish");
          Class c = obj.getClass();
          System.out.println("The name of the class is "+ c.getName());  //Output:java.lang.String
          Method[] m = c.getDeclaredMethods();
          for(Method m1:m){
            System.out.println(m1.getName());  //Output: Methods available in java.lang.String class
          }
          Program p = new Program();
          Class c2 = p.getClass();
          System.out.println("The name of the class is "+ c2.getName()); //Output:Program
        }
      }

  Example 2: To display database vendor specific connection interface implemented classname.
  => Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection();
     System.out.println(conn.getClass().getName());
    
    Note: After loading every .class file, JVM will create an object of the type java.lang.Class in the heap area.
          Programmer can use this class object to get class level information.
          We can use getClass() method very frequently in reflections.


e. finalize() method
=> Just before destroying an object, garbage collector calls finalize() method to perform cleanup activities.
   Once finalize() method completes, automatically garbage collector destroys that object.


Other methods in Object class:
    wait(), notify(), notifyAll() 
    => We can use these methods for inter-thread communication. 
       The thread which is exception updation, it is responsible to call wait() then immediately the thread will enter into waiting state.
       The thread which is responsible to perform updation, after performing updation, the thread can call notify() method.
       The waiting thread will get that notification and continue it's execution with those updates.
